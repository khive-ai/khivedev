## 1. Claude Code Users Journey Map

### Persona Profile
- **Primary Users**: Claude Code users leveraging memory for session continuity
- **Technical Level**: Varied (non-technical to expert developers)
- **Primary Goal**: Seamless persistent memory across conversations
- **Key Pain Points**: API inconsistency, search failures, update broken

### Current Journey - Python MCP

#### Stage 1: Discovery & Onboarding
**Touchpoints**: `.claude/settings.json` configuration, first MCP tool usage

**Current Experience**:
```
User discovers Memory MCP → Configures settings → First save attempt
```

**Friction Points**:
- Hidden namespace isolation (users don't know memories are isolated)
- No visibility into memory types or proper usage
- Cryptic error messages during setup failures
- No debugging tools to understand what went wrong

**Pain Point Impact**:
- **#5 Namespace Confusion**: Users unknowingly create isolated memory spaces
- **#10 Poor DX**: Bad error messages prevent successful onboarding

#### Stage 2: Daily Usage Patterns

**2A: Memory Storage Flow**
```
User mentions preference/fact → Claude saves automatically → User unaware of storage
```

**Current Pain Points**:
- **#4 No Duplicate Detection**: Same preference saved multiple times
- **#7 Type Rigidity**: Limited to 4 types (note/fact/event/preference)
- **#8 Metadata Limits**: Can't store rich contextual information

**Real Example**:
```
User: "I prefer TypeScript for all my projects"
Claude: save("User prefers TypeScript", type="preference", topics=["coding"])
→ 3 days later same conversation → duplicate entry created
```

**2B: Memory Retrieval Flow**
```
User asks question → Claude searches memory → Results returned
```

**Current Pain Points**:
- **#3 Search Issues**: Empty queries return random results
- **#2 API Inconsistency**: Different response formats confuse users
- **#9 Performance Issues**: Hidden rate limits cause failures

**Real Example**:
```
User: "What were my coding preferences?"
Claude: search("coding preferences") → Returns random memories or fails
```

**2C: Memory Update Flow**
```
User corrects information → Claude attempts update → Often fails
```

**Current Pain Points**:
- **#1 ID Management**: Short IDs from search don't work with update
- **#6 Update Broken**: Update operations fail 80% of the time

**Real Example**:
```
User: "Actually I prefer Python now, not TypeScript"
Claude: update("abc123", {"content": "User prefers Python"}) → FAILS
→ Creates duplicate instead of updating
```

#### Stage 3: Troubleshooting Journey

**Current Experience**:
```
Something fails → Cryptic error → User confused → Claude can't help → Frustration
```

**Pain Points**:
- **#10 Poor DX**: No debugging tools or clear error messages
- **#9 Performance Issues**: No visibility into rate limits or system health
- Users have no way to understand what went wrong

## 5. Decision Trees for Common Operations

### Memory Storage Decision Tree

```
User wants to store information
├─ Is this a duplicate of existing memory?
│  ├─ YES → Update existing memory with new information
│  └─ NO → Continue to type classification
├─ What type of memory is this?
│  ├─ Episodic (temporal, contextual event)
│  │  └─ Store with timestamp and context
│  ├─ Semantic (general knowledge, facts)
│  │  └─ Store with confidence score and associations
│  └─ Working (temporary, task-specific)
│     └─ Store with priority and expiration
├─ Should this be consolidated later?
│  ├─ HIGH importance → Mark for semantic consolidation
│  └─ LOW importance → Allow natural decay
```

### Memory Retrieval Decision Tree

```
User asks a question
├─ Is this a specific memory lookup?
│  ├─ YES → Direct ID-based retrieval
│  └─ NO → Continue to search strategy
├─ What search strategy should be used?
│  ├─ Temporal query → Search episodic memories by time range
│  ├─ Conceptual query → Semantic search with similarity scoring
│  ├─ Current context → Search working memory first
│  └─ General search → Multi-type search with ranking
├─ Are results satisfactory?
│  ├─ YES → Return ranked results
│  └─ NO → Expand search or suggest alternatives
```

### Memory Update Decision Tree

```
User wants to update information
├─ Can we identify the specific memory?
│  ├─ YES → Proceed with atomic update
│  └─ NO → Search for similar memories first
├─ Is this a correction or enhancement?
│  ├─ Correction → Update content, preserve metadata
│  └─ Enhancement → Merge information, update confidence
├─ Should we create a new version?
│  ├─ Significant change → Create version history
│  └─ Minor change → Update in place
├─ Update successful?
│  ├─ YES → Confirm and log change
│  └─ NO → Rollback and report error
```

### Error Handling Decision Tree

```
Operation fails
├─ What type of error occurred?
│  ├─ Network/Connection → Retry with backoff
│  ├─ Validation → Return clear error message
│  ├─ Permission → Check authorization
│  └─ System → Escalate to monitoring
├─ Can we recover automatically?
│  ├─ YES → Attempt recovery, log incident
│  └─ NO → Return error with guidance
├─ Should we degrade gracefully?
│  ├─ Critical operation → Return cached result if available
│  └─ Non-critical → Return partial results with warning
```
